## 1
I was trying to figure out the logic on how i'm going to implement each class and method into my command line application, I written the application without classes to get locked down on the functions that I require for application to work as I would like to interact and function for the user, to make functions which implements **DIY** (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself)  methodology.

Covert my index.rb methods/vars/data to Classes in the class_Trivia.rb from methods. Fine tuning the input of answer other than the defined answers true = 1 or false = 0 to better provide a clearer user experience
